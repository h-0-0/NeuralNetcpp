# NeuralNetcpp
Neural Network written from scratch in C++ with unit testing (using google test). 
Currently supports:
  - Creating and training a feedforward neural network with SGD using the MSE as the loss

Future roadmap:
  - Add functionality for easily handling and training on data
  - Add more activation functions
  - Add more loss functions
  - Optimize code, including getting it to work on GPU's
  - Different optimizers (eg. SGD with momentum, Adam, etc.)
  - Different layer types (eg. convolutional)
  - Examples that use the library
